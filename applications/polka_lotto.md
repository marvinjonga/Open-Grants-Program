## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

Polka Lotto is a lottery application that will run on Polkadot. Polka Lotto will be implemented on its own parachain that is connected to Polkadot. Users will pay a participation fee and stand a chance to win the pooled amount if they correctly guess the winning lottery numbers.

Polkadot is going to become quite popular and a household name, because of that, I have chosen to build on this platform. Running a lottery application using blockchain technology allows for transparency and fairness.

### Project Details 

People using Polka Lotto application will add in the lotto numbers they think will win. Polka Lotto will run on its own parachain and it will have its own native token that will be used to reward players that correctly guess the winning combinations.

The following logic will be implemented using RUST: 

. There are between 40 and 49 balls in a main set of balls.
· There are between 5 and 7 balls drawn from the main set.
· There are up between 5 and 49 balls in a powerball set.
· There are between [0 to 3] number of balls drawn from a powerball set.
 
When the ‘Play’ button is pressed ,the correct number of balls are chosen from the ball set and the powerball set. This combination is displayed, showing the both the balls and the powerball(s) if there are any.

All previous winning combinations and their draw times will also be stored and made available to users of the app.
